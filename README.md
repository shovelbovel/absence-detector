- **Authentication and Role System**: Secure access management based on user profiles
- **Adaptive Dashboards**: Customized interfaces according to user roles
- **Report Generation**: Automatic creation of attendance and absence reports

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Optimized system for smooth usage
- **Traceability**: Complete history of actions and modifications
- **Scalability**: Architecture allowing future extensions

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Django**: Python web framework
- **MySQL**: Database (via XAMPP)
- **REST API**: Communication between frontend and backend

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Web page structure
- **CSS3**: Styling and formatting
- **JavaScript**: Client-side interactions

### Development Tools
- **XAMPP**: Local development environment
- **MySQL**: Database management system

## Architecture
The project follows Django's **MVT (Model-View-Template)** architecture:
- **Model**: Data management and business logic
- **View**: Request processing and control logic
- **Template**: Presentation and user interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- XAMPP (for MySQL)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/absence-detector.git
   cd absence-detector
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the database**
   - Start XAMPP and activate MySQL
   - Create a database named `absence_detector`
   - Configure connection settings in `settings.py`

5. **Apply migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the application via `http://localhost:8000`
2. Log in with the created credentials
3. Navigate according to your role (Administrator, Manager, Employee)
4. Manage absences through the dedicated interface
5. View reports and dashboards
